        <p>
                 I want to discuss about the game Dead Space, which I played through in its entirety. The setting in the galaxy was the best aspect of the game, which was truly awesome.
                <p>
                    I became so engrossed in the game that I began to read articles and watch documentaries regarding alien existence. There were numerous locations throughout the game where we could listen to audio logs or recorded messages, which was novel to me and I really enjoyed listening to it.

        <p>The entire game series had engaging storyline and enjoyable gameplay.</p>
